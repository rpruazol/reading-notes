# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

- One must consider the pros and cons of using a particular data structure.  What are the constraints (speed, efficiency, etc) vs the other data structures and of course if it solves the stated problem.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

- Ensure that the function has a base case that indicates when the recursion should stop, preventing an infinite loop.
