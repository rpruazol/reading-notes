# Prep Your Mindset

## Tasks

While this is a technology course, success with the deluge of work within depends heavily on the mindset that you bring to the table.

With that in mind, this is some prework to get us all on the same page about dealing with difficulty in our lives.

**Note**: If you've already watched/read/listened to the below before, just take some time and revisit them.

We could all use mindset reminders.

## Things I want to know more about


- Deliberate practice is something I would like to focus more.  Is there a framework that I can use somewhere to help with this, especially in class?

- Growth mindset is nice in theory, but putting it in practice has been quite a challenge for me personally.

- I appreciated this quote from 'Redefining Success' video:
> Here's an insight that I've had about success: You can't be successful at everything. We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't. So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is. And I think any wise life will accept, as I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding.
