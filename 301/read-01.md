# Read-01 Introduction to React and Components

## Summary - Components and props are core topics when working in React.  They allow you to think about your web application in a more object oriented approach while props is your key to passing Javascript to your components.

What is a “component”?
> A component is the concept of breaking down a design (website in this case) into multiple pieces that have defined functionality with the purpose of being reusable

What are the characteristics of a component?
> Components are reusable, well defined, not context specific, extensible, encapsulating, and independent

What is “props” short for?
> "Props" is short for "properties"

How are props used in React?
> Props are used to pass information into components, in our case javascript.

What is the flow of props?
> Props flow one way top down, meaning a parent component can pass it's props to it's child components.  However child components cannot pass props to it's sibling elements nor can they pass props back up to the parent.
