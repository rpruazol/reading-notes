# API Keys
### Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
