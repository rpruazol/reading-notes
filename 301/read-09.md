<br>

- What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a style of software development that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
> Pure function is a function that is not affected by global variables
- What are the benefits of a pure function?
> Pure functions will have results not affected by outside sources (global variables)
- What is immutability?
> Is a state where your data cannot change after it's affected.
- What is Referential transparency?
> If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
