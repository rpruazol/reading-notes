**1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?**  
SQL databases are able to create complex queries against large sets of data spread across multiple tables.

**2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?**  
NoSQL databases due to the key-value structure of the data

**3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.**  
SQL databases scale vertically, like getting the newest iphone every year.  NoSQL databases scale horizontally means getting another phone so you can watch Youtube and browse Twitter at the same time.

**1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we "relate" them?**
A one-to-many relationship means that one table has data that shares the same data as other tables.

**2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to  _______ a _______ of the database tables and their relationships.**  
Develop a schema

**3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.**
Primary key is a unique identifier for each row of data.  A foreign key establishes a relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

**1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?**  
Keywords are reserved words that define actions that we can do in a database or table and do not change.  Parameters are generated by the user and can change.

**2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.**  
Normalizing data means formatting the data received so it is the same as the existing data, making the data consistent.

**3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.**  
**One-to-one:** Student ID and student name  
**One-to many:** The college and what students are attending  
**Many to many:**  Books in a library and what student has checked what out
