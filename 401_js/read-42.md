### Summary

The article generally discusses how 100 Microsoft employees protested the company's collaboration with Immigration nand Customs Enforcement (ICE).  I agree with the article in that it paints the protesting in a positive light, mainly the reason of:

> The letter is part of a wave of tech workers mobilizing this week against the Trump administration’s new “zero tolerance” policy that refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization. The policy has resulted in about 2,000 children being separated from their migrant parents, raising a bipartisan outcry.

By working with ICE, Microsoft does not put itself in a stance where they, "want to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence."
