> **Q: How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**\
> **A:** Javascript inherently can only run in browers.  Node is a way to run Javascript code without one.

> **Q: What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**\
> **A:** This means that Node is Javascript that is run on a platform.  In other words, Node runs Javascript code.

> **Q: What is Node used for?**\
> **A:** Node is used to run Javascript code in it's own process rather than in a browser.  As a result this allows Javascript code to be used to do things other programming languages can do such as creating server-side applications, scripts, and access filesystems.
