# Relational Databases and SQL

### Summary

- Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns in a predefined, strict schema that can support complex relationships across multiple tables. This differs from a non relational database or NoSQL database like MongoDB where there is no schema and supports multiple data types, making it more flexible than it's counterpart.  SQL is used to interact specifically with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL.
